# DataBox Server

This is the server for the DataBox project. It is a RESTful API built with Java Spring that allows users to upload and 
download files directly from the user interface, and is responsible for storing and retrieving files from the database.

## To run the server:

Launch the SpringBoot application from the IDE of your choice, or run the following command from the root directory:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

_To enable the server to function, the database must be set up and running. To set up the database, see the attached 
instructions in the report._
